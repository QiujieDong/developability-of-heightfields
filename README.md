# Developability of Heightfields
Public code release for ["Developability of Heightfields via Rank Minimization"](http://dgp.toronto.edu/~sgsellan/pdf/compressed-developables.pdf), presented at SIGGRAPH 2020 and authored by [Silvia Sell√°n](http://dgp.toronto.edu/~sgsellan/), [Noam Aigerman](https://noamaig.github.io) and [Alec Jacobson](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/). Please note that while this Matlab implementation of our method is hereby released under MIT License, the method itself is pending a US patent filed in 2020 by Adobe Inc.



## Installation
We have only succesfully validated this installation on MacOS 10.15 with Matlab 2020a, but are confident it should work on most Unix-based machines and versions of Matlab from the past five years. 

To install this library, please start by cloning the repository recursively
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sgsellan/developability-of-heightfields.git
```
After this, we will build the mex functions in the `gptoolbox` directory:
```
cd developability-of-heightfields/gptoolbox/mex
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Then, build our own mex files by entering Matlab and, in Matlab, adding this repository in its entirety to your Matlab path (for instance, by running `addpath(genpath(path/to/developability-of-heightfields))`), navigating to `developability-of-heightfields/mex` and running `setup_mex` in the Matlab console.

## Use
To use our code in the exact same way we did for most our paper results, run in
Matlab
```
gui_developables(path/to/some/mesh)
```
and follow the instructions in the console. For example, you can start by trying
```
gui_developables('data/bunny.obj')
```
 
We also allow you to replicate the results from our developable interpolation
results (Figs. 18 & 19). Simply look at `interpolation_grayscale.m`, follow the
instructions to use your own constraints and link to the image in Line 14. You
can also run it as is to recover our output from Fig. 18.

## Known Issues
Please do not hesitate to contact
[sgsellan@cs.toronto.edu](mailto:sgsellan@cs.toronto.edu) if you find any issues
or bugs in this code, or you struggle to run it in any way.

## Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative
We, the authors, hereby give the Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative and its reviewers permission to review the code and advertise the review publicly after the stamp is approved.
